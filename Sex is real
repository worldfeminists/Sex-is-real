Sex is real.
Sex is a biological characteristic we were born with, like the blood type. There is no way to change that with current technology.
Gender claim can be different in different situations. We use different names for different social websites and register with different dates of birth. On the internet you can freely choose your gender or not choose any gender all. At work, you can self-identify gender, just like you can have a preferred name. 
In situations where biological sex plays a significant role, it should not be self-identified. For example, in women's shelter, women's prison, women's ward in a hospital, young girls' toilet etc. 
Gender dysphoria is a psychological disorder. It does not change a person's biological sex. It makes people want to change their sexual identity.  Researches have shown many children with gender dysphoria turn out to be lesbian or gay after puberty. 
LGB and T should separate. Lesbian, gay, bisexual are sexual orientations, which are subjective feelings, i.e. with whom do they want to have intercourse with. They can be fluid. Transgender is the sexual identity of oneself. It does not involve other people.
The tendency that children who have identified themselves as transgender turn our be lesbian or gay after puberty may indicate the necessity to clearly differentiate biological sex and sexual orientation. 
One way to compromise is to officially designate gender and sex separately. Gender for general social situations and sex for situations where biological characters matter.
